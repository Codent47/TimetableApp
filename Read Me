This is a basic app aimed to help first yearites in my Institiute: BITS. There are several options given to BITSians to chosse timetable from.
These options are in the form of a code. Many students carry their timetable as an image which gets lost in Gallery. So, it takes up a lot time
to check next class. This app aims to help students with that.

This app let's you chosse your timetable code and will display your timetable. This also gives students the freedom to lookup for an alternative class
in some other code in case they miss their own.
